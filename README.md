## User Story

```
AS a birder
I WANT to be able to search a country of interest
SO THAT I am presented with birds found in that country and local weather
I WANT to be able to hear different bird calls in preparation for a trip to that country
SO THAT I can be familiar with local bird calls when I get there
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage with a drop-down/input bar
WHEN I search for a country
THEN I am presented with birds found in that country and the weather for that area
WHEN I click a bird call button
THEN I am able to listen to a recorded call of them in the wild
```
